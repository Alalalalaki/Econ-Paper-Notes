    "The solow model, despite its simplicity, is a dynamic general equilibrium model, though many key features like preferences and dynamic optimization are missing here. In Solow model, the households will not be optimizing, and thus one has no need to specify the utility function. Accordingly, the saving rate is set to be constant and exogenous. And Labor supply is inelastic and exogenous. \n",

    "In the real world, however, the effect of population growth on economic growth is somehow complicated and vague. The above mechanism shares some essence with the Multhian theory that the growth of factors for production is somehow constrainted comparing to the growth of population. However, a larger population often means more researchers and more discovery of new ideas, which leads to technological growth. This feature is embedded in the endogenous growth model since Romer, though not always be ture in the view of economic history. Moreover, this question goes further complicated if we consider the factor that dynamic change of population growth is in nature relevant with aging. An aging population due to decreasing population growth can lower economic growth through an excess of savings relative to investments as well as reduced labor force participation and labor productivity."

This solution illustrates that starting from any $k(0),$ the equilibrium $k(t) \\rightarrow k^{*}$, and the rate of adjustment is related to $(1-\\alpha)(n+\\delta)$.

One way to sustain the growth is to prolong the transition path. The CD case above has already showed that when $α$ is close to 1, adjustment to steady-state level can be very slow. A very slow adjustment toward a steady state has the flavor of sustained growth rather than the economy quickly settling down to a steady state. The simplest way to get sustained growth is the so-called **AK model**, in which we relax assumption 1&2 and suppose $$F[K(t), L(t), A(t)]=A K(t)$$. The law of motion now becomes $$\\frac{\\dot{k}(t)}{k(t)}=s A-\\delta-n$$, and as long as the RHS is larger than 0, there will be constant growth in capital-labor ratio and output per capita as well. However, the AK model is a knife-edge case which requires production function to be linear in capital stock and capital ratio towards 1, which is not very realistic. \n",

    "In order to get balanced growth, we need to make an additional assumption on the production function. In particular, Uzawa's Theorem proves that aggregate production function must have a representation with **Harrod-neutral (purely labor-augmenting) technological progress**, i.e. $$F[K(t), A(t) L(t)]$$. This form implies that an increase in technology $A(t)$ increases output as if the economy had more labor. See Acemoglu for the proof of the Theorem. One simple way to think about this requirement is that given the fact of sustained growth and constant capital-output ratio, the aggregate output and capital need to grow at the same rate greater than population growth $n$. This creates an asymmetry between capital and labor as capital is now accumlating faster than labor. Constancy of growth and key assumption 1 on production function require the technological change to make up for this asymmetry, thus technology should take a labor-augmenting form."

Because we can define $A(t)=\\left[A_{K}(t)\\right]^{\\alpha /(1-\\alpha)} A_{L}(t)$, then $$Y(t)=[K(t)]^{\\alpha}[A(t) L(t)]^{1-\\alpha}$$, which has the form of purely labor-augmenting technological progress. Then both capital-augmenting technology $A_{K}(t)$ and labor-augmenting technology $A_{L}(t)$ could grow asymptotically, while maintaining balanced growth. As CES equals to 1 in CD case, difference between two technology does not matter, and  Harrod-neutral, Solow-neutral, and Hicks-neutral forms of technological progress are simple transforms of one another.

    "Given Uzawa Theorem, production function now takes form $Y(t)=F[K(t), A(t) L(t)]$. Additional to population growth $n$, the labor-agumenting technology is assumed to grow at rate $g$. Now instead of capital per capita, we define the capital per effective labor (i.e. efficiency units of labor) as $k(t) \\equiv \\frac{K(t)}{A(t) L(t)}$. This allows the balanced growth return to a steady-state on the transformed state variables. We will again have $\\dot{k}=0,$ but the definition of $k$ has changed. This transformation thus makes the analysis much easier than those with nonbalanced growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the effective capital-labor ratio, we define output per unit of effective labor as $y(t)  \\equiv f(k(t)) $. \n",
    "And the income per capita is $$\\hat{y}(t) \\equiv Y(t) / L(t) =A(t) y(t)=A(t) f(k(t))$$. Clearly that if $k(t)$ and $y(t)$ remain constant in the steady state, income per capita, $\\hat{y}(t),$ will grow over time, at rate the same as $A(t)$. Hence the terms steady state and balanced growth path is used  interchangeably. The law of motion is thus $$\\frac{\\dot{k}(t)}{k(t)}=\\frac{s f(k(t))}{k(t)}-(\\delta+g+n)$$. Now total savings $sf(k)$ are used for replenishing the capital stock not only for depreciation and population growth, but also for the labor-augmenting technological progress, which reduces the effective capital-labor ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "The comparative static and transitional dynamics with technological progress are similar to the dynamics without technological change. We can implement Solow model with balanced growth path by assuming a CD production function with form $F = K^{α} (A_L L)^{1-α}$. The code in last section can do this by setting $g$ not equal to 0 and $A$ equal to 1. However, note that the \"per capita\" in the figures  now actually means \"per effective labor\"."

    "Though economists like steady state, the real world is perhaps more like infinite transitions from one state to another. Comparative dynamics show the dynamic response (i.e. entire path of adjustment) of an economy to a change in its parameters or to shocks. This is useful because basic Solow model and its neoclassical cousin are often used for analysis of policy changes, medium-run shocks, and business cycle dynamics.\n",
